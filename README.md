🎵 MusicGen: MIDI-based Music Analysis and Audio Synthesis
MusicGen is a Python-based Jupyter Notebook project that explores symbolic music generation and audio synthesis using MIDI files. The notebook leverages tools like pretty_midi, fluidsynth, and the MAESTRO dataset to transform MIDI data into audible waveforms, visualize musical structure, and extract key note information.

Overview
This project serves as a hands-on guide for:

Understanding and working with MIDI data

Synthesizing MIDI into real audio using software-based synthesizers

Analyzing musical features such as instruments, pitch, note durations

Visualizing the waveform of generated audio clips

Whether you're a machine learning researcher, digital music enthusiast, or student exploring audio processing, MusicGen offers a practical and interactive experience.

📂 Key Features
✅ MAESTRO Dataset Integration – Automatically downloads and extracts real-world piano performances.

✅ MIDI File Parsing – Extracts instrument, pitch, duration, and structural information.

✅ Audio Rendering – Converts MIDI into playable audio using fluidsynth.

✅ Waveform Visualization – Uses matplotlib to plot audio waveforms.

✅ Educational Comments – Well-commented code for learning and reproducibility.
